# Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria: A Hypothesis on the Biochemical Basis of Bodily Discomfort

Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria (EPD) describes a biochemical conflict between brain neurobiology and the hormonal environment, manifesting as depression, anxiety, physical discomfort, or a sense of bodily alienation. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) stabilizes the condition, reducing symptoms and restoring harmony.

## Introduction: My Journey and Gratitude to the Community

Drawing from personal experience, corroborated by clinical observations common among transgender individuals, I am grateful to the transgender community for the support and inspiration that helped me understand myself. This vibrant community—trans women, trans men, non-binary individuals—advocates for acceptance and self-expression. However, for the medical aspects of bodily discomfort, I propose a new approach, free from sociology and politics. EPD focuses on biology, inviting scientific discussion.

## The Problem with Current Frameworks: Terminological Confusion

Current classifications, such as “gender dysphoria” (DSM-5) or “gender incongruence” (ICD-11), conflate biological, psychological, and social factors, complicating diagnosis and perpetuating stigma. EPD emphasizes biochemistry, separating medical approaches from social debates.

## My Experience: Bodily Signals

Born in a body classified as male with physiological male hormone levels, I experienced depression, anxiety, and physical discomfort since adolescence. Bupropion, prescribed for depression, increased testosterone, triggering aggression and bipolar disorder symptoms. Discontinuation improved my condition, suggesting a biochemical conflict.

## Signaling Hypothesis

EPD arises when the body’s hormonal profile conflicts with the brain’s neurobiological needs. The body signals dysfunction through depression, anxiety, or discomfort. Social factors are secondary, akin to stress exacerbating diabetes (*Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism*, 2018).

## Scientific Basis

Studies suggest transgender individuals’ brain structures may align with their identified sex (*Zhou et al., 1995*). HRT reduces symptoms, improving quality of life (*Transgender Health*, 2020; *Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology*, 2023).

## EPD as a Diagnostic Framework

EPD is a biochemical condition requiring medical intervention, similar to diabetes. It is not a medical transition but an alignment of the body with neurobiological needs. Surgery is not mandatory; HRT is often sufficient.

## Conclusion: A Call for Scientific Inquiry

EPD is a hypothesis requiring research. I invite researchers and clinicians to study its biochemistry, develop diagnostics, and support patients. The goal is to humanize medicine and depathologize transgender experiences.

## Disclaimer

EPD is a preliminary hypothesis requiring clinical validation. The terms “Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria” and “neurobiological sex” are proposed concepts, not recognized medical categories.
