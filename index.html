            <h1>Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria: A Hypothesis on the Biochemical Basis of Bodily Discomfort</h1>
            <p>Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria (EPD) describes a biochemical conflict between brain neurobiology and the hormonal environment, manifesting as depression, anxiety, physical discomfort, or a sense of bodily alienation. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) stabilizes the condition, reducing symptoms and restoring harmony.</p>

            <h2 id="introduction_en">Introduction: My Journey and Gratitude to the Community</h2>
            <p>Drawing from personal experience, corroborated by clinical observations common among transgender individuals, I am grateful to the transgender community for the support and inspiration that helped me understand myself. This diverse community—trans women, trans men, non-binary individuals—plays a key role in advocating for acceptance and freedom of self-expression.</p>
            <p>However, when it comes to the medical aspects of bodily discomfort, I propose a new approach, free from sociology and politics.</p>
            <p>The term <strong>Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria</strong> (EPD) describes the biochemical conflict underlying this discomfort, and I call for its scientific discussion.</p>
            <h2 id="problem_en">The Problem with Current Frameworks: Terminological Confusion</h2>
            <p>Current classifications, such as “gender dysphoria” (DSM-5) or “gender incongruence” (ICD-11), conflate biological, psychological, and social factors, complicating diagnosis and perpetuating stigma. Terms tied to “gender” imply that discomfort stems from social identity, whereas many of us experience <strong>physical signals</strong> indicating a biochemical conflict.</p>
            <p>EPD, as I propose, focuses on biology, separating the medical approach from sociological and political debates. This does not mean that people with EPD cease to be transgender. It simply means that transgender individuals who do not require medical intervention should not be associated with medical diagnoses (this is about complete depathologization).</p>
            <h2 id="experience_en">My Experience: Bodily Signals as a Case Study</h2>
            <p>I was born in a body classified as male, with a hormonal profile “normal” for that sex: high testosterone, low estrogen. From adolescence, my body signaled issues: chronic acne, depression, fatigue, irritability after ejaculation, and episodes of anger with self-harm. Expressing femininity brought euphoria and calm.</p>
            <p>Prescribing bupropion for depression increased testosterone production, leading to uncontrollable aggression, self-harm, and symptoms of bipolar affective disorder type 2. Discontinuing the medication restored femininity and reduced emotional instability. Social stigma, including fear of judgment, exacerbated my condition but was not its cause.</p>
            <h2 id="hypothesis_en">EPD as a Signal of Biochemical Conflict</h2>
            <p>Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria arises when the body’s hormonal profile does not match the brain’s neurobiological needs. If the brain is structured in a way typical of one sex (e.g., female) while the body produces hormones of another (male), a conflict emerges. As a result, individuals experience depression, anxiety, a sense of bodily alienation, “foreign” reflection, and physical discomfort.</p>
            <p><strong>These are bodily signals</strong> indicating negative processes in the organism.</p>
            <p>Social factors, such as stigma, do not cause EPD but can exacerbate its manifestations, similar to how stress worsens diabetes.</p>
            <p>Analogies with endocrine conditions support the hypothesis. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), excess testosterone causes acne and aggression (<em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism</em>, 2018). During menopause, reduced estrogen leads to depression (<em>Psychoneuroendocrinology</em>, 2015). EPD is a similar biochemical imbalance.</p>
            <h2 id="science_en">Scientific Basis: Neurobiology and Endocrinology</h2>
            <p>Research shows that transgender individuals’ brain structures (e.g., hypothalamus) may align more closely with the sex they identify with (Zhou et al., 1995; Kruijver et al., 2000). Prenatal hormone exposure shapes these differences (<em>Nature Reviews Endocrinology</em>, 2020; <em>Neuroscience</em>, 2024). Even if current hormonal levels are “normal,” the brain may be programmed for a different hormonal environment, causing discomfort.</p>
            <p>Hormones modulate dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways, affecting mood (<em>Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews</em>, 2019). Testosterone enhances aggression via dopamine receptors, while estrogen stabilizes the serotonergic system (<em>Psychoneuroendocrinology</em>, 2017). HRT reduces depression and anxiety in transgender women (<em>Transgender Health</em>, 2020; <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>, 2022), improves quality of life (<em>The Lancet Psychiatry</em>, 2018), and induces neuroendocrine changes correlating with reduced dysphoria (<em>Journal of Psychiatric Research</em>, 2021; <em>Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology</em>, 2023).</p>
            <h2 id="diagnosis_en">Diagnosis and Treatment of EPD</h2>
            <p>EPD is a biochemical conflict between brain neurobiology and the hormonal environment, manifesting as depression, anxiety, and/or physical discomfort. Diagnosis involves:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>History</strong>: Psychiatric and hormonal biography (diagnoses, medications, symptoms from childhood and puberty). EPD may cause secondary disorders, such as depression. Differential diagnosis excludes psychogenic (PTSD, dysmorphophobia) and social causes. EPD is an endocrine condition, independent of gender identity (<em>Transgender Health</em>, 2020).</li>
                <li><strong>Testing</strong>: Exclusion of endocrine disorders of the assigned sex (TSH, testosterone/estradiol, cortisol). A normal hormonal profile with persistent symptoms suggests EPD.</li>
                <li><strong>Trial HRT</strong>: Low-dose estradiol and anti-androgens (AMAB) or testosterone (AFAB) under medical supervision (3–6 months). Improvement confirms EPD.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment</strong>: HRT, with optional orchiectomy (AMAB) or oophorectomy (AFAB). Surgery is not mandatory.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="table-responsive">
                <table class="table table-bordered">
                    <tr><th>AMAB</th><th>AFAB</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>Testosterone, TSH, cortisol</td><td>Estradiol, progesterone, TSH</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>HRT: estradiol, anti-androgens</td><td>HRT: testosterone</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Orchiectomy (optional)</td><td>Oophorectomy (optional)</td></tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p>These criteria are preliminary and require further research.</p>
            <h2 id="future_en">Future of Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria</h2>
            <p>EPD offers a medical approach to bodily discomfort as an endocrine condition, excluding social and gender aspects. If validated, EPD could replace “gender dysphoria” in ICD/DSM, reclassifying it as an endocrine disorder.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protocols</strong>: Trial HRT as a diagnostic tool, personalized HRT, optional surgery.</li>
                <li><strong>HRT Side Effects</strong>: Risks (thrombosis, cancer) are minimized through transdermal forms and genetic testing (<em>Endocrine Reviews</em>, 2019). HRT requires medical supervision, personalized dosing, and regular monitoring. The decision for therapy must balance benefits and risks.</li>
                <li><strong>SERM/SARM</strong>: Selective receptor modulators as alternatives to HRT with fewer side effects (<em>Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology</em>, 2023).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>EPD requires clinical research to develop diagnostics and treatments, promoting transgender depathologization and focusing on biochemistry.</p>
            <h2 id="nosology_en">EPD as a New Nosology</h2>
            <p>I propose viewing Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria as a biochemical condition requiring medical correction, similar to diabetes. A disease is something that impairs life, and EPD causes suffering, alleviated by HRT or surgery. This is not “gender transition” but aligning the body with neurobiological needs. Surgery is not mandatory; HRT is often sufficient.</p>
            <h2 id="social_en">Social and Medical Aspects</h2>
            <p>The transgender community unites people with diverse paths: social self-expression, medical correction, or a combination. All paths deserve respect. EPD is a medical condition tied to biochemistry, not social identity.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion_en">Conclusion: A Call for Dialogue</h2>
            <p>Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria is my proposal to describe the biochemical conflict that I and others experience. I thank the transgender community for the inspiration that helped me formulate this hypothesis. My goal is to offer a medical approach free from sociology and politics. I invite scientists, clinicians, and all interested parties to study EPD’s biochemistry, develop diagnostics, and help people find harmony. Together, we can make medicine more humane and reduce stigma.</p>
            <h2 id="disclaimer_en">Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>This concept is preliminary and requires clinical research, cross-sectional studies, and multidisciplinary discussion. The terms “Endocrine-Perceptive Dysphoria” and “neurobiological sex” are proposed concepts, not officially recognized medical categories. Their validation depends on future scientific research.</p>
